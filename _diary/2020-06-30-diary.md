### Discussion

What are your thoughts on *Unsubscribe's* box office success?

> I've heard that the movie industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus epidemic, so I thought the success of the new sales format which *"Unsubscribe"* made was good news for them.

Would you be interested in watching *Unsubscribe*? Why? Why not?

> I became interested in *"Unsubscribe"* after reading the article. Because It's a 29 minute short movie, so it's relatively easy to watch, and I'm also technically interested in the movie made with Zoom.

Are you a fan of horror films? If so, what's the best one you've seen recently? If not, why not?

> No, I'm not good at scary horror films. As a world-famous horror movie, I watched aliens and exorcists when I was little.

Would you rather be an actor or a filmmaker? Why?

> If either of those two, I want to be a filmmaker. Film is an exciting work that requires teamwork, so it is called comprehensive art. Also, it is a personal preference to think of visual design.

Do you think you'd enjoy working as a YouTuber? Why? Why not?

> I think working as a Youtuber is tougher than imagined. Because they have to post videos every day, keeping in mind the trends of society and the changing interest of users.
